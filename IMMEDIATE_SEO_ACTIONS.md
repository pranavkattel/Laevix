# 🚨 EMERGENCY SEO FIX - Get Indexed NOW!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE
Your website is NOT showing in Google search because **Google doesn't know it exists yet!**

The SEO optimizations are perfect, but you need to tell Google about your website first.

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (DO THIS NOW!)

### STEP 1: Is Your Website Live? ⚡
**Check this FIRST:**

```
❓ Is your website accessible at a PUBLIC URL?
   ✅ YES: https://www.laevix.com (or similar)
   ❌ NO: Only running on localhost:8080
```

**If running only on localhost:**
- ❌ Google CANNOT see it

npm install -g netlify-cli

# 2. Login
netlify login

# 3. Deploy (from your project folder)
cd D:\laevix-digital-ascent-main\laevix-digital-ascent-main
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

#### Option B: Vercel
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
cd D:\laevix-digital-ascent-main\laevix-digital-ascent-main
vercel --prod
```

#### Option C: Your Own Hosting
- Upload the `dist` folder after running `npm run build`
- Point your domain to the hosting server
